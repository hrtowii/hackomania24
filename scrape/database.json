Wage increases relating\n    to Qualifying Years 2013-2015 were no longer eligible for payouts from 1 Dec 2018.4In Budget 2020, the qualifying gross wage ceiling was raised from $4,000 to $5,000 for 2019 and 2020.Local government agencies, international organisations and businesses not registered in Singapore do not qualify for WCS. See the full employer exclusion list.Additional Eligibility ConditionsAn employer would not be eligible for a payout under any of the circumstances below: The employer was an entity with no substantial trade or business; The employer had given, in IRAS' opinion, false or misleading information to IRAS in order to obtain a payout or a higher amount of payout; The employer (either singly or with another person) had used, in IRAS' opinion, one or more artificial, contrived or fraudulent steps in order to obtain a payout or a higher amount of payout;  The employer was convicted in the qualifying or preceding year for making CPF contributions to Singaporeans who were not actively employed by the firmAn employer would not be eligible for a payout for a wage increase given to a particular employee who: Did not carry out any substantive work for the employer; Effectively controlled the employer (i.e. controls decision making power and management of the business or company) If the total wages paid by an employer for a period is not commensurate with the volume or nature of activity carried out by the employer in that period, then the employer is only eligible for an amount of payout that, in IRAS' opinion, corresponds\n        to the increase in the total wages that is commensurate with such volume or nature of activity. If the total wages paid by an employer to a particular employee for a period is not commensurate with the volume or nature of work carried out by the employee in that period for the employer, then the employer is only eligible, in\n        respect of that employee, for an amount of payout that, in IRAS' opinion, corresponds to the increase in the total wages paid to that employee for that period that is commensurate with such volume or nature of work. If an employer had failed to give to IRAS, by the time specified by IRAS, any information requested by IRAS for the purpose of determining the employer's eligibility for a payout or the amount of payout the employer is eligible for, with respect\n        to one or more employees, then the employer would not be given the payout for these employees.Additional Terms of DisbursementThe Government has the right to withhold, suspend or deny the disbursement of any WCS payout to an employer if the employer was reasonably suspected or found to:be ineligible to receive a payout; orhave carried out or participated in any criminal activity in the course of carrying on its trade or business.If the employer is reasonably suspected or found to have been ineligible or involved in criminal activity at the time any previous payouts were disbursed, the Government also has the right to recover from the employer an amount equal to any payout disbursed,\n    from the time the employer: (a) was ineligible to receive a payout; or (b) first carried out or participated in the criminal activity.Here, “criminal activity” means any activity which, if carried out, is a criminal offence (including but not limited to money laundering or vice-related activities), regardless of whether such activity is related to the WCS.\n\n\n   Computation of Wage CreditWage Credits on each qualifying employee will be computed as follows:Assume a new employee was hired since 2012 until Sep 2021; and was given gross monthly wage increases of $200 in 2013, $300 in 2014, $100 in 2015, $200 in 2016 and $500 in 2017, $100 in 2018, $200 in 2019 and $100 in 2020 and 2021. Under First Extended WCS(2016 - 2017)Under Second Extended WCS & Budget 2020 (2018 - 2020)Budget2021Year201620172018201920202021Qualifying Wage Increase$300$800$600$800900$400Govt Co-Funding20% x $300 = $60/mth20% x $800 = $160/mth20% x $600 = $120/mth15% x $800 = $120/mthThe additional 5% x $800 = $40/mth15% x $900 = $135/mth15% x $400 = $60/mthAmount of Wage Credit$60 x 12mths = $720$160 x 12mths = $1,920$120 x 12mths = $1,440$120 x 12mths = $1,440$40 x 12mths = $480$135 x 12mths = $1,620$60 x 9mths = $540To be Paid inMar 2017Mar 2018Mar 2019Mar 2020Jun 2020(Budget 2020 Supplementary payout)Mar 2021Mar 2022Gross Monthly Wage = Total wages (basic salary and additional wages such as overtime pay and bonuses) paid by the employer to the employee in a calendar year / Number of months in which CPF contributions were made.As announced by the Government on 8 April 2021, excess Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) payouts were credited to some businesses in October 2020 due to errors in the reopening dates used to determine the JSS payouts. Affected businesses have been informed directly. Businesses with excess JSS amounts outstanding might have these offset against future WCS payouts if eligible. Please write in to reopeningdate@mti.gov.sg if you wish to make payment arrangements to return the excess JSS payout.\n\n\n   Receiving Wage CreditApplication was not required. IRAS notified eligible employers by post of the Wage Credit payable to them by end Mar of the payout year.When is the payoutPayouts were given to employers by 31 Mar of the payout year.How do employers receive the payoutIn line with Singapore’s Smart Nation efforts, all WCS payouts were disbursed through either GIRO or PayNow Corporate. No cheques were issued for the payouts.Payouts were automatically  credited to employers' GIRO bank\n account for Income Tax/GST. For those without GIRO accounts,\n the payout were credited to their bank accounts that were registered with PayNow Corporate5. Employers who were not already on these direct crediting modes would have to sign up for these modes to receive their payouts.5Organisations can sign up for PayNow Corporate by linking their organisation’s UEN (without suffix) [e.g. ROC (2019XXXXXA), ROB (531XXXXXA), UEN (T19LLXXXXA)] to their bank account via internet banking. The nine banks participating in\n    PayNow Corporate are United Overseas Bank, DBS Bank/POSB, OCBC Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Maybank, Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited. For assistance, please approach these banks.Is the Wage Credit payout taxable?The Wage Credit payout was a government grant that co-funded wage increases given to your employees. Hence it was considered revenue that was taxable in the hands of the employers. The payouts were taxed in the relevant Year of Assessment corresponding\n    to the year you received the payouts. Individuals (including sole-proprietors) and partnerships were not required to declare the Wage Credit payout received in their income tax returns (Form B/B1 or Form P) as this was automatically included by IRAS in their tax assessments for the relevant\n    YA.\nCompanies were however, required to declare the Wage Credit payout received in their income tax return (Form C/Form C-S) for the relevant YA.\n\n\n   Submitting a Request for Wage Credit BreakdownPlease note that IRAS no longer accepts requests for breakdown details.\n\n\n   Appealing for Wage Credit AdjustmentThe last date to submit an appeal was 30 Jun 2022.\n\n\n   Background and Contact InformationBackground of the SchemeThe Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) was part of the 3-Year Transition Support Package introduced in Budget 2013.As announced in Budget 2015, the Government extended the WCS for two more years, i.e. 2016 and 2017, to give firms more time to adjust to rising wages in the tight labour market.In Budget 2018, the WCS was extended for three more years, i.e. 2018, 2019 and 2020, to support businesses embarking on transformation efforts and encourage sharing of productivity gains with workers.In Budget 2020, the government co-funding ratios for wage increases in 2019 and 2020 were further raised from the current 15% and 10%, to 20% and 15% respectively. The qualifying gross wage ceiling was also raised from $4,000 to $5,000 for both years.In Budget 2021, the Scheme was extended by one year, with the government co-funding ratio remaining at 15% for wage increases given in 2021, and the qualifying gross wage ceiling maintained at $5,000.Through WCS, businesses affected by economic restructuring received Government support to manage rising labour costs. The payouts allowed businesses to free up resources to make investments in productivity and share the productivity gains with\n    their employees.Contact IRASEmail us: wcs@iras.gov.sg\n\n\n   FAQs\n\n\n   A. General Questions on the Scheme (8)\n\n\n    \n        \n            What is the Wage Credit Scheme (WCS) and its objectives?\n        \n\n\n        In Budget 2013, the Wage Credit Scheme was introduced as a three-year Scheme under which the Government co-funded 40% of the wage increases given to Singapore Citizen employees earning a gross monthly wage of not more than $4,000 over the period 2013\n    to 2015.In Budget 2015, the Scheme was extended for two more years, i.e. 2016 and 2017. Wage increases given to Singapore Citizen employees earning a gross monthly wage of not more than $4,000 in 2016 and 2017 were co-funded at 20% instead of 40%. In addition,\n    gross monthly wage increases (at least $50) previously given in 2015 and 2016 by the same employer were co-funded at 20% if they were sustained in 2016 and 2017.In Budget 2018, the WCS was further extended for three more years, i.e. 2018, 2019 and 2020, to support businesses embarking on transformation efforts and encourage sharing of productivity gains with workers. Government co-funding was maintained at 20%\n    in 2018. Subsequently, the co-funding ratio stepped down to 15% in 2019 and 10% in 2020.In addition, gross monthly wage increases (at least $50) given in 2017, 2018 and 2019 by the same employer would continue to be co-funded at their respective level of co-funding if they are sustained in 2018, 2019 and 2020.In Budget 2020, the government co-funding ratios for wage increases in 2019 and 2020 were raised from the current 15% and 10%, to 20% and 15% respectively. The qualifying gross wage ceiling was also raised to $5,000 for\n    both years, up from the current $4,000.During this period of economic restructuring, businesses could face a tight labour market with rising wages. Through the Scheme, the Government provides businesses with co-funding support for wage increases made to their employees. This would allow businesses\n    to free up resources to invest in productivity, and to share productivity gains with their employees. In Budget 2021, the WCS was further extended by one year for wage increases given in 2021. Gross monthly wage increases (at least $50) previously given in 2019 and 2020 by the same employer will continue to be co-funded at the respective levels of co-funding if they are sustained\n    in 2020 and 2021.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Who will qualify for the Wage Credit Scheme?\n        \n\n\n        Employers qualify for Wage Credits if they fulfil the following:Gave at least a $50 increase in gross monthly wage to Singapore Citizen employees earning up to the Gross Monthly Wage ceiling*;Made CPF contributions for these employees for at least three months** in the year of the wage increase (\"qualifying year\"); andThe employees who received the wage increase must have received CPF contributions for at least three months with one employer in the preceding year.*As announced in Budget 2020, the qualifying gross wage ceiling was raised from $4,000 to $5,000 for 2019 and 2020.**The three months minimum employment duration need not be continuous.Please refer to Wage Credit Scheme website / Qualifying Conditions.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Why was the Wage Credit Scheme extended? What are the changes under the extended Scheme?\n        \n\n\n        The WCS was extended to help firms cope with near-term cost pressures as they embark on transformation efforts, and to encourage employers to share productivity gains with workers.\n\nGovernment co-funding was maintained at 20% in 2018. Subsequently, the co-funding ratio stepped down to 15% in 2019 and 10% in 2020. It was then raised to 20% and 15% for 2019 and 2020 respectively as announced in Budget 2020.\n\nIn addition, gross monthly wage increases (at least $50) given in 2017, 2018 and 2019 by the same employer would continue to be co-funded at their respective level of co-funding if they were sustained in 2018, 2019 and 2020.\n\n\nIn Budget 2021, the co-funding ratio was maintained at 15%, and the gross monthly wage increases (at least $50) previously given in 2019 and 2020 by the same employer will continue to be co-funded if they are sustained in 2020 and 2021.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Is the Wage Credit Scheme a permanent Scheme?\n        \n\n\n        The Wage Credit Scheme aims to provide transitional support to help businesses cope with near-term pressures as they embark on transformation efforts. It is not a permanent Scheme.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            How does the Government know the wages that I pay my employees? Is it necessary for the company to give a wage increment to the employees?\n        \n\n\n        The wages are derived from the compulsory CPF contributions that the employer makes for the employee.Where there are irregular or significant changes to the CPF contributions made, IRAS may carry out investigations before or after the payouts, to check on the authenticity and correctness of any employee and the wages. Any attempt by the employer to abuse the Scheme to receive Wage Credit payout or to obtain excessive payout will be dealt with seriously.\nWages are determined by the market. It is ultimately for the employers to decide how much pay increase, if any, to give, and to consider the sustainability of the increased wages in subsequent years.\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Why was the co-funding at 40% from 2013 to 2015, 20% from 2016 to 2019 and only 15% in 2020 and 2021?\n        \n\n\n        A 40% co-funding for wage increases given from 2013 to 2015 was to provide significant help to employers, while ensuring that they bear a sufficiently large portion of the increase in the long term after the Scheme ended.\nThe co-funding was reduced to 20% from 2016 to 2019 and further tapered to 15% in 2020 and 2021 to phase out the wage support gradually.\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            If I meet the qualifying conditions, am I legally entitled to a payout?\n        \n\n\n        Wage Credit is a cash grant to employers who meet the Scheme's qualifying criteria. It is not paid pursuant to any legislation or in connection with any legal obligation of the Government, and hence no employer has an absolute right to any cash payment under the Scheme.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            How does the Government ensure that the wage increases I give my employees can be sustained after the Scheme ends?\n        \n\n\n        Under the Scheme, the larger proportion of the wage increase is borne by the employer to ensure sustainability of the increased wage in subsequent years. We encourage businesses to take advantage of the suite of productivity measures offered by the Government\n    to improve their productivity. The Wage Credit payouts help businesses upgrade and retain their workers before their productivity investments take off. This would help businesses ensure that the wage increases given to their employees are sustainable\n    over the longer term.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   B. How the Scheme Works (8)\n\n\n    \n        \n            Why is the Wage Credit computed based on the gross monthly wage instead of basic wage of an employee? Why is the qualifying wage only up to $5,000?\n        \n\n\n        Consistent with the flexible wage system, employers can choose whether to increase wages through the basic or variable components of salary, or both. Businesses, especially SMEs, welcome the flexibility as they practise diverse compensation approaches.\n\nWith the cap at a wage level of $5,000 the scheme benefits the majority of the lower and middle income group of Singapore Citizens.\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            If my employee’s gross monthly wage was reduced in 2020 but subsequently increased in 2021, would I be eligible to receive the Wage Credit payout for Qualifying Year 2021?\n        \n\n\n        Yes, provided the increase in the gross monthly wage from 2020 to 2021 was at least $50.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            If my employee worked for me for four months in 2021, how is his gross monthly wage computed and how is the Wage Credit computed?\n        \n\n\n        His gross monthly wage will be calculated from the total wages that you paid him in 2021 divided by 4, which is the number of calendar months in which his CPF contributions were made by you in 2021. If there is any increase, of at least $50, in the gross monthly wage over his gross monthly wage in 2020, you will receive Wage Credit for the qualifying year 2021 (to be paid in Mar 2022 based on 15% of his increase in gross monthly wage), for the 4 months.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            My employee joined the company in Nov 2020 but left in Feb 2021. As he had been employed by the company for a total of four months, will my company qualify for Wage Credit in qualifying years 2020 and 2021?\n        \n\n\n        No, your company will not qualify for Wage Credit in qualifying years 2020 and 2021 as the employee was employed by your company for less than three months in 2020 and less than three months in 2021.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            I have recruited a new employee from Feb 2021 who had worked with two different employers in 2020 (each more than three months). How would the Wage Credit be computed assuming his gross monthly wage in 2021 is $2,500 and the gross monthly wages in 2020 was $2,000 under employer A and $2,100 under employer B?\n        \n\n\n        The highest of the employee's previous gross monthly wages will be used to compute the Wage Credit, which in this case is $2,100 under employer B.\nWage Credit for QY2021:\nMar 2022 Payout = 15% of ($2,500 - $2,100) X 11 months = $660\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            If I paid my employee a bonus for his 2020 performance in 2021, will the bonus be considered in the computation of my employee’s gross monthly wage for 2020 or 2021?\n        \n\n\n        The bonus will be reflected in the employee's gross monthly wage for 2021, i.e. the year in which the payment was made.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            I have increased the hourly wage of my hourly-rated employee who has now chosen to work fewer hours each month. How would the Wage Credit be computed?\n        \n\n\n        Wage Credit is computed based on the increase in the gross monthly wage. For hourly-rated employee, the gross monthly wage has to take into account the hourly wage and the actual number of hours worked. Hence even if the hourly wage might have increased,\n    there might not be an increase in the gross monthly wage if the employee has chosen to work fewer hours each month. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   C. Eligibility Criteria for Employees (8)\n\n\n    \n        \n            Are part time and contract workers covered by the Scheme?\n        \n\n\n        Yes, all part-time, hourly rated, contract and full-time employees are covered by the Scheme, as long as they are paid CPF contributions by their employer.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            I own a business and am paying CPF contributions to myself. Will I qualify for the Wage Credit?\n        \n\n\n        No. The following individuals will not qualify as employees under the Wage Credit Scheme:\n- Sole proprietors and partners of general partnerships/ limited liability partnerships/ limited partnerships. - Employees who are both shareholders and directors (as defined in Section 4(1) of the Companies Act) of the company they are employed in, or employees\n    who are both members and directors in the case of a company limited by guarantee. - Self-employed individuals including but not limited to commission agents, taxi-drivers, owners of professional practices.The Wage Credit Scheme aims to encourage employers to share productivity gains with their employees. As the individuals listed above are also owners/ members/ directors of the company or business, they are not considered employees for the purpose of the\n    Wage Credit Scheme.\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            I am a self-employed or a business owner. If I were to work for another firm in 2021, will the firm be able to benefit from the Wage Credit by employing me?\n        \n\n\n        You will be a new hire with no previous employment to consider when computing the preceding year's gross monthly wage. Hence, no Wage Credit can be derived in your first year of employment with the firm.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            My new employee previously worked for an employer who is on the employer exclusion list. Will I be able to qualify for Wage Credit?\n        \n\n\n        Yes, you will be able to qualify for Wage Credit based on the increase in the gross monthly wage over his previous year's gross monthly wage, even though his previous employer was on the employer exclusion list.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Will employers qualify for Wage Credit for new hires?\n        \n\n\n        The Government recognizes that there will be job switching during the qualifying years period. Employers hiring new employees will benefit from the Scheme in the year of hire as long as the employee had worked for at least three calendar months with the same employer (need not be you) in the previous year, and the new employer pays him a gross monthly wage of at least $50 more than his previous employer in the previous year. This wage increase will be computed automatically based on the employee's CPF contribution records, and Wage Credit will be paid out to the employer if all conditions of the Scheme are met.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            My employee was hired in Jan 2019 and she was on no pay leave for the whole year in 2020 before returning to work in 2021. Will I be able to qualify for Wage Credit in qualifying year 2021?\n        \n\n\n        Yes, you will qualify for Wage Credit in qualifying year 2021 based on the wage increase you gave the employee in 2021 over 2019. This is provided that the employee had worked with you for at least three calendar months in 2019 and 2021 and did not\n    seek active employment while on no-pay leave.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Our company has a Singapore Citizen employee who is working at an overseas branch of my company, or has been seconded to another company in Singapore. Will our company be eligible for the Wage Credit?\n        \n\n\n        The payout will be given to the employer who has made the CPF contribution for the said employee. The same applies to any other employment arrangements. The payout will only be given to the employer who has made the CPF contribution based on the CPFB's record.\n\n \n\nSo long as your company is not on the employer exclusion list, you may appeal for Wage Credit for your Singaporean employees who are posted to an overseas branch or seconded overseas, even though the company does not have to pay CPF contributions for these employees.\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Will I qualify for Wage Credit if I receive Senior Employment Credit (SEC) for an employee?\n        \n\n\n        Yes, an employer may qualify for both SEC and WCS for an employee. The two Schemes serve different purposes. The SEC Scheme provides businesses with support to hire older Singaporean workers while the WCS supports businesses embarking on transformation efforts and encourage sharing of productivity gains with workers.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   D. Eligibility Criteria for Employers (5)\n\n\n    \n        \n            Are non-profit organisations registered in Singapore eligible for the Scheme?\n        \n\n\n        Yes, public companies limited by guarantee, societies and charities and institutions of a public character are eligible for the Scheme if they make CPF contributions for their employees.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Are companies co-funded by the Government eligible for the Scheme?\n        \n\n\n        Yes, if they are not listed in the exclusion list.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Will I qualify for Wage Credit if the training for employees is funded by Workforce Development Agency (WDA)?\n        \n\n\n        Yes, as long as the employer had made CPF contributions to the employee for the wages paid to the employee, and the rest of the eligibility criteria are satisfied, the employer will qualify for Wage Credit for this employee.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            I gave a wage increase to my employee in the qualifying year 2021, but my business was closed down during the year. Will I be receiving the WCS Payout in Mar 2022?\n        \n\n\n        The gross monthly wage and the Wage Credit for the qualifying year 2021 can only be computed after the end of the year 2021, and the payout will only be disbursed to the registered business entity in Mar 2022. If your business entity had already been\n    deregistered in Mar 2022, it will not receive the WCS payout.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            If I engage a third-party contractor to hire my workers, will I benefit from the WCS? Can the contractor transfer the Wage Credit to me?\n        \n\n\n        The Wage Credit is paid to the employer registered with CPF Board, and is taxable.If the third-party contractor is the registered employer, he will receive the WCS payout. Whether the Wage Credit is to be shared between you and the third-party contractor is a private arrangement between both parties.\nIf the contractor transfers part or all of the Wage Credit to you, the amount received by you would correspondingly reduce your manpower cost allowed for tax deduction.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   E. What Employers Need to Do (7)\n\n\n    \n        \n            Do I need to apportion the gross monthly wage if the employee is remunerated based on the working days?\n        \n\n\n        No. The gross monthly wage is computed based on the CPF contributions you make for the employee.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            What is the cut-off date for employers to make CPF contributions to qualify for Wage Credit?\n        \n\n\n        As per CPF requirements, CPF contributions for each month are due at the end of each month. However, employers have a grace period of 14 days to pay CPF contributions after the end of the month. If the 14th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Public Holiday,\n    the grace period will be extended to the next working day.\nEmployers should thus ensure that all CPF contributions on wages are paid by the 14th of the following month.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Will late CPF contributions and adjustments to CPF contributions be accepted for the Scheme?\n        \n\n\n        For each qualifying year, the deadline for late contributions/adjustments in relation to wages paid in the qualifying year is 14 Jan of the subsequent year. If 14 Jan\n    falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Public Holiday, the deadline will be extended to the next working day. All late contributions/adjustments paid after this deadline will not be used in the computation of Wage Credit. The usual penalties apply to\n    late CPF contributions.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Is there a minimum Wage Credit before payment is made?\n        \n\n\n        For employers who have a GIRO bank account with IRAS (for Income Tax or GST), or have registered with PayNow Corporate [by linking the organisation’s UEN (without suffix) to the bank account], their Wage Credit will be credited directly into the account regardless of the amount.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            Is the Wage Credit taxable? Why?\n        \n\n\n        The Wage Credit payout is a government grant that co-funds wage increases. Hence, it is considered a revenue that is taxable in the hands of the employers. \n    \n\n    \n        \n            When will the Wage Credit be taxed and do I need to declare the Wage Credit received in my Tax Return?\n        \n\n\n        The payouts will be taxed in the relevant Year of Assessment corresponding to the year you received the payouts. Payouts may be used to offset any of your outstanding tax.\nIndividuals (including sole-proprietors) and partnerships are not required to declare the Wage Credit Scheme payout received in their income tax returns (Form B/B1 or Form P) as this will be automatically included by IRAS in their tax assessment for the relevant YA.\nCompanies are however, required to declare the Wage Credit Scheme payout received in their income tax return (Form C/Form C-S) for the relevant YA. \n    \n\n    \n        \n            What if my company name changes during the qualifying year?\n        \n\n\n        If the UEN of the business is unchanged, Wage Credit will automatically be paid out to the same UEN. If the UEN of the business changes, the business can appeal to IRAS to amalgamate the records of the old UEN with the new UEN. The employer may submit\n    an appeal and it will be considered on a case-by-case basis, to establish if there is indeed a transfer of rights and obligations.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ","https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/skillstraining?src=govassist_grants":"GoBusiness","https://www.imda.gov.sg/imtalent/programmes/citrep-plus":"\n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            \n                    \n                        On this page\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            About\n                            Programmes\n                            Contact\n                    \n                \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                                        An initiative of SkillsFuture, TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) aims to build and develop a skilled Information and Communications Technology (ICT) workforce for Singapore’s digital economy.

By adopting TS-FWA and offering FWAs in their HR policy, employers will be able to support greater provision of FWAs and attract more senior\n    workers to remain in the workforce. Additionally, committing to provide SCP to mature employees in the HR policy and sending their company representatives to attend the SCP workshop will increase the adoption of SCP, which will help senior workers\n    stay relevant in the workforce and enable employers to benefit from retaining experienced and well-trained workers.How does New PTRG benefit employees?Companies which successfully applied for the New PTRG will need to ensure their employees are offered the option to reduce their work intensity and undertake part-time work arrangements during\n the re-employment phase.

Firms must apply for the funding support on behalf of their employees before commencement of the course.\n    Are Goods and Services Tax (GST) funded under the Workforce Training and Upgrading Scheme?\n    GST is not covered under the Scheme. The reimbursement of the training and assessment fees is before GST.\n    Is there a limit to how many applications I can make for the employees in my company?\n    There is no limit to the number of applications that your company can make if your employees are eligible.\n    Can I apply for funding for other courses which are not recognised as higher qualification training in your list if they also improve productivity?\n    No. Only courses approved by BCA and listed on BCA’s website qualify for funding support.\n    Will we need to submit a claim form?\n    No. Your Training Provider will submit the claims on your behalf. Please monitor and ensure that your Training Provider makes the claim application within 1 month after the completion of the approved courses / assessments and the release of examination / assessment results.\n    How long will it take for the funding to be disbursed after the claim is approved by the WTU administrator?\n    After the claim application is approved, it will take about 3 months for the Finance Department to disburse the funding via GIRO.\n    Is it mandatory to apply for GIRO account?\n    Firms that tap on WTU funding more than once are required to apply for GIRO account. This is to streamline the disbursement process and ensure that firms receive their claims within a shorter period of time.\n    When can we start applying for fund support and make a claim thereafter?\n    Your company can make the application at least one (1) working day before the start of the course. Claims will be processed automatically by the WTU administrator once the Training Provider has uploaded the necessary supporting documents, on the condition that all funding criteria are met.\n    When was Workforce Training and Upgrading (WTU) Scheme ceased?\n    The WTU Scheme has ceased on 31 Mar 2022, as part of the effort to streamline training grants across the Whole of Government.  Funding applications submitted after 31 Mar 2022 will not be accepted.

In this tier, we fund S$3,000 for each report written.\n                Enhanced Tier: Eligible applicants must produce at least 40 equity research reports. Applicants can claim S$4,000 from the grant per equity research report from the 40th report, capped at the 80th report. \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            Qualifying Reports\n            \n            Research Reports\n            \n                Eligible equity research reports must be authored or co-authored by Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, with at least 50%[6]  by Singapore Citizens.\n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n \nHow to Apply\nInterested applicants can write to fsdf@mas.gov.sg  for more information. \n\n    Applicants of Listing Grant can submit their applications no longer than three months after the issuance or listing date. \n    Applicants of Research Development Grant should express interest and submit their claims to fsdf@mas.gov.sg  and SGX gemsresearch@SGX.com , no later than three months after the application anniversary (i.e., 12 months from the date of application or anniversary). \n    Applications with incomplete information or do not meet the criteria stated above will result in longer processing time. \n    The GEMS scheme will be valid from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026 (both dates inclusive).\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] SPACs will only qualify for one-time claim upon listing and not at the stage of de-SPAC. \n[2] Issuer must submit the GEMS Listing Grant application within a maximum of 15 months from the date of their Technical Secondary listing on the SGX. If the issuer conducts a follow-on fundraising within 12 months of its listing, the GEMS Listing Grant application should be submitted three months from the date of the follow-on fundraising or within the 15-month period from the original listing, whichever occurs earlier. Each listing is limited to a single claim submission.\n[3] Excludes all applicable Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) and other equivalent taxes.\n[4] Intangible assets (“IA”) valuation fees are for the valuation of the IA of an issuer, usually provided by an auditor. IA evaluation fees are for the qualitative analysis and assessment of a company's IA portfolio, usually provided by intellectual property (“IP”) service providers such as legal firms which have the relevant expertise to assess IP.\n [5] Issuers can submit claims for fees paid to an external consultant/reviewer for the production and issuance of a Sustainability Report for the purpose of listing on the SGX Mainboard or Catalist. Ongoing costs relating to a Sustainability Report after the listing will not be considered an eligible expense. The Sustainability Report should be prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Report requirements for SGX Mainboard and SGX Catalist listed companies/issuers set out by SGX RegCo, or any subsequent guidance by MAS or SGX. Some examples of eligible expenses include (i) Sustainability Report drafting and review fees; (ii) Sustainability Reporting assurance fees.\n[6] This percentage is applied to the total number of equity research reports submitted by each eligible applicant for each claim cycle. For avoidance of doubt, the figure will always be rounded up.\n\n    ","https://www.ibf.org.sg/programmes/Pages/IBF-STS.aspx":" Oops​We've looked everywhere - looks like this page is missing.This might be because the web address might have been entered incorrectly or the page has moved.For help, please visit our FAQ Centre.

This workgroup, comprising delivery platforms, hawkers associations, community partners and government agencies, will be working closely together to support our hawkers by:\n\n    Helping them go digital,\n    Develop a sustainable commercial model\n    Raise consumer awareness about delivery platforms\n\nBesides helping hawkers with adoption of digital payment platforms, our Digital Ambassadors will also be making their rounds to hawker centres to understand hawkers’ needs and to share the benefits of food delivery platforms. Interested hawkers can speak to our Digital Ambassadors at SG Digital community hubs or call us at 6377 3800.\nGo contactless, go e-payment!\nIn these extraordinary times, maintaining public health and safety is a top priority. To help stallholders reduce physical contact with their customers, we encourage adoption of the SGQR1, unified digital payment solution.\nEnterprise Singapore (“ESG”) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (“IMDA”) are partnering the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”), JTC Corporation (“JTC”) and National Environment Agency (“NEA”) to accelerate the roll-out of the Unified e-Payment Solution nationwide in HDB coffee shops, NEA hawker centres and JTC industrial canteens. \nIn this new phase of the initiative, stallholders will be encouraged to adopt a contactless digital payment option by adopting an unique SGQR label at their stall. By using a SGQR, stallholders will be able to receive digital payments through 19 different payment schemes, including DBS PayLah!, GrabPay and Singtel Dash.\nTo help support hawkers, NETS is giving $3 cash bonus for every 10 NETS transactions to all hawkers as well as canteens, coffee shops, food courts, and eating houses when they accept NETS payments until 31 July 2021\nConsumers are encouraged to reduce contact by paying with NETS ATM Card or NETS QR.\nMore details can be found on NETS.\nHow to sign up\nStarting from June 2020, the SG Digital Office will be deploying a team of Digital Ambassadors to encourage stallholders in over 100 NEA hawker centres and markets, HDB coffee shops, and JTC industrial canteens to adopt SGQR codes for e-payment.

According to the National Nutrition Survey 2010, 60% of Singaporeans eat out for lunch and/or dinner at least four times a week. With the War on Diabetes announced in 2016, there has been an even greater importance on health promotion and disease prevention.\nWith this background, to promote the use of existing healthier ingredients by the food service industry so as to improve the diet quality of Singaporeans when eating out, Health Promotion Board introduced the Healthier Ingredient Promotion Scheme (HIPS) on 1 July 2018.\nThe HIPS covers both oil and grain staples, mainly rice and noodles, as well as sugar-sweetened beverages, sauces, desserts, wholegrain products, sweet spreads and table salt. The scheme encourages food manufacturers to innovate and market a wider variety of healthier ingredients and products suited to local tastes, as well as supports the industry in promoting the uptake of healthier ingredients in Singapore's food service.\nScheme Coverage\nThere are three supportable categories under HIPS, namely: (1) Marketing and Publicity; (2) Trade Promotion; and (3) Ingredient Thematic Promotion.\n\n    Marketing & Publicity\n\nHIPS encourages and supports continuous efforts made by scheme participants to market the healthier ingredient/product to F&B operators in Singapore, so as to increase their receptiveness towards healthier ingredients. Supportable items include, but are not limited to, product sampling, advertising, and cost of designing and printing marketing collaterals.\n\n    Trade Promotion\n\nTrade promotion will be supported to recognise scheme participants' active engagements to increase receptivity of Singapore's F&B operators towards the healthier ingredient/product. Examples of trade promotion include, but are not limited to, trade discount, bulk purchase rebates, and customer loyalty benefits.\n\n    Ingredient Thematic Promotion\n\nIngredient thematic promotion  is part of HPB's efforts to connect suppliers with F&B operators, to encourage the latter to incorporate healthier ingredients such as brown rice into their regular dishes, and increase the availability of healthier options. Examples of ingredient thematic promotion include, but are not limited to, hawker centre wholegrain activations, food courts and restaurant chains wholegrain promotions, and loyalty schemes for regular purchase of healthier ingredients.\nSupportable ActivitiesPlease click here for the list of Supportable Activities under each Category.\n\nFunding Quantum\nHIPS will fund up to 80% of total qualifying project investment, and scheme participants will co-pay 20% of the remaining project cost for (1) Marketing and Publicity; and (2) Trade Promotion.

Zero-GST (ZG) warehousesWhen you import goods (including goods belonging to your overseas principal) into a  Zero GST (ZG) warehouse,\n you must declare the imports in your GST return despite the suspension of GST. You should declare the value of imports in Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases) even though GST is suspended.When the goods are later removed from ZG warehouse into customs territory under MES,  you should declare the value of goods removed in:Box 5 (Total value of taxable purchases); andBox 9 (Total value of goods imported under Major Exporter Scheme/ Approved 3rd Party Logistics Company Scheme or Other Approved Schemes).They must be supported by valid ME / MC / Customs permits and relevant supporting documents (e.g. commercial invoices and appropriate shipping documents). \n\n\n   Easing complianceThe TradeXchange Repository Service provides an online platform for the consolidation of relevant trade documents,\n    to help businesses meet the recordkeeping requirements for imports and exports with greater ease.

What type of permit should I declare?\n        \n\n\n        You need to take up a ME permit with Singapore Customs.\n    \n\n    \n        \n            I have submitted a letter of guarantee to IRAS for application/renewal of my Major Exporter Scheme. My letter of guarantee has expired. Do I need to submit a new letter of guarantee?\n        \n\n\n        No. When your letter of guarantee expires (i.e. end of the guarantee period), the letter of guarantee is effectively null and void. Thus, the Comptroller does not return the letter nor issue a letter of release.During the renewal of your MES status, the requirement of a letter of guarantee is also reviewed. You will be informed if a new letter of guarantee is required.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            ","https://www.go.gov.sg/iras-eis":"\n        \n        I've checked the link.
